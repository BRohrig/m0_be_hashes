# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I didn't have any problems with this section, hashes seem incredibly useful!
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
To be honest I have not been taking a ton of notes so far as the material has seemed fairly straightforward and linear. Once the quantity of information increases I'm sure I will be spending more time note taking.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I always attempt to solve the problem on my own using the information I have before googling. I usually try to set a 30 minute time limit on my own attempts before seeking outside help, as I seem to always find a new rule or something that I CAN'T do, which is useful to know.
